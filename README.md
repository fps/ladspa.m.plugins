# ladspa.m.plugins

A few simple LADSPA plugins useful for the ladspa.m synthesis suite.

# Why?

Because I couldn't find a single oscillator plugin among the existing LADSPA suites that actually worked with the rapid frequency changes needed for e.g. a kick drum.

# Notes

These plugins have been created with correctness in mind. Efficiency is an afterthought if considered at all.
